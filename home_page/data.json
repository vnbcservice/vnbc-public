    "articleContent": "“This is the practice of mine, and of yours. The guiding principle of this practice is contained in the single word ‘return.’ To return here means no longer wandering in search. To return here means having seen one’s own path. To return here is to come home—to the island of oneself, to one’s true nature. To return here is to return to our ancestors, to our homeland, to our parents, to our Teacher, to the True Dharma, and to the Sangha. The homeland is a place of affection, warmth, and peace. To return here also means to return to our children and grandchildren.”  - Thích Nhất Hạnh\n",
